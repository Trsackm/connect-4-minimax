    <p><span id="subhead">T</span>he rules of Connect 4 are very simple. You will be playing a game against a computer
      player. Each round, you will have to add a piece to a column and the computer will do the same. The pieces fall to
      the bottom of the board and stack up. To add a piece to a column, click on a cell in the column.</p>
    <p>The game ends when there are either four in a row, a column, any diagonal of the same color, or when there are no
      more legal moves. </p>
    <p> This computer player uses a recursive algorithm to find the optimal move. It may take time for it to find the
      right move. So don't click too many times if there is some lag.</p>
    <p> You can set the difficulty with the "difficulty" slider and you can reset the game by clicking on the "reset"
      button. I hope you enjoy this game. </p>

    <p> PS: This picture is a reference for the positioning of the pieces on the board. The game indicates the last move
      played by both "yellow" and "red".</p>
